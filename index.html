    <h1>dayala</h1>

    <p id="bio">I was born in Boston and grew up there and in NYC. After graduating with a BFA from SVA, I backpacked for 8 months in Europe and Turkey. From there, I moved to Rosarito Beach (the offical beach of Tijuana -- just as glamorous as that sounds...) and became an ESL teacher. After an "exciting" year there, I moved to SF in 1990.</p><p>In 1995, I started my business and over the past 21+ years have gone through enormous changes -- at times havinng a business partner and employees to the current interation and return to my roots. Just me, trying to make it work. I am turning 50 this year and it is very strange to no longer be able to stand on solid ground - the established foundation of my professional expertise and reputation â€” and be in a sort of limbo. I am still running my business but know that I must guide it and myself towards change and growth. Taking classes at CCA is a part of this process.</p>
