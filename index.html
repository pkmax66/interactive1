    <p id="bio">I was born in Boston and grew up there and in NYC. After gradutating with a BFA from SVA, I backpacked for 8 months in Europe and Turkey. From there, I moved to Rosarito Beach (the offical beach of Tijuana -- just as glamorous as that sounds...) and became an ESL teacher. Kaz is a designer, a baseball connoisseur, and a new father. Originally from Japan, grew up in the Bay Area, lives in San Mateo, and commutes to San Francisco to teach and work. He has an MFA in Design from California College of the Arts, and a BS in Visual Communication from University of California, Davis.</p>
